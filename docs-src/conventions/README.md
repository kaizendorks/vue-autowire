# Getting Started

The aim of Vue-Autowire is to replace code manually importing and registering components, views, mixins etc with a simple convention based around file and folder names.

Instead of writing this:

```js
import Navbar from '@/components/Navbar.vue'
import MyMixin from '@/mixins/my-mixin.js'

export default {
  components: {
    Navbar,
    UserSurvey: () => import('@/components/UserSurvey/UserSurvey.vue')
  },
  mixins: [MyMixin],
  ...
}
```

You decide how to name your folder/files so autowire can find your assets and automatically register them in the Vue instance.
For example, with the **default convention**:
- Components and views ending with `.async.vue` are registered as [async components](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/components-dynamic-async.html#Async-Components) and bundled in their own webpack chunk
- Components and views ending with `.local.vue` are ignored and still need to be manually registered from other views/components
- Any other component and view ending with `.vue` will be registered in the Vue instance
- Mixins and directives found in their respective folders are registered in the Vue instance

```
# So you can structure your code as
/components
  Navbar.vue
  /UserSurvey
     UserSurvey.async.vue
     SurveyQuestion.local.vue
  ...
/directives
  ...
/mixins
  my-mixin.js
/views
  ...
```
```js
// And automatically register Navbar, UserSurvey and my-mixin within the Vue instance
// The UserSurvey is automatically registered as async component based on its file name!
import VueAutowire from 'vue-autowire'
import defaultConventions from 'vue-autowire/src/conventions'
Vue.use(VueAutowire, defaultConventions)
```

## Using the full default convention
Vue-Autowire comes with default conventions for each of the different types of assets that it can handle:
- [components](./components.md)
- [views](./views.md)
- [directives](./directives.md)
- [filters](./filters.md)
- [mixins](./mixins.md)
- [routes](./routes.md)

You can use them all by importing the overall default convention
```js
// Use the default conventions for components, views, directives, mixins and routes
import defaultConventions from 'vue-autowire/src/conventions'
Vue.use(VueAutowire, defaultConventions)
```

Read through each of the specific asset type sections to find out more about their default conventions.

If you want to find out which of the different asset types were found and registered by Vue-Autowire, you can inspect the contents of `Vue.autowire`!

## Using asset-specific default conventions
Of course, if you are interested only certain conventions, you can simply import the ones you need:
```js
// Use only the default conventions for components and routes
import defaultComponentConventions from 'vue-autowire/src/conventions/components'
import defaultRoutesConventions from 'vue-autowire/src/conventions/routes'
Vue.use(VueAutowire, Object.assign({}, defaultComponentConventions, defaultRoutesConventions))
```

::: warning
When using only a subset of the default conventions, always import only the specific convention files!

Ie, if you just want to use the component conventions you should `import defaultComponentConventions from 'vue-autowire/src/conventions/components'` rather than `import { components } from 'vue-autowire/src/conventions'`.
This is because at build time, webpack will follow the chain of `import` statements and parse any `require.context` statements found **regardless of whether you end up using them or not**.
Always make sure you only import files containing `require.context` that you need!
:::

You can also mix and match these default conventions with your own ones:
```js
// Use the default mixin and directives conventions but your own components conventions
import defaultMixinConventions from 'vue-autowire/src/conventions/mixins'
import defaultDirectiveConventions from 'vue-autowire/src/conventions/directives'
Vue.use(VueAutowire, Object.assign({}, defaultMixinConventions, defaultDirectiveConventions, {
  components: {
    requireContext: require.context('@/components', true, /\/(?:[^.]+|(?!\.local\.vue$)|(?!\.async\.vue$))\.vue$/),
    requireAsyncContext: require.context('@/components', true, /async\.vue$/, 'lazy')
  }
}))
```

::: warning
Avoid importing a convention that you will later override!

Ie, if you just want to use your own component conventions you should
manually define the convention rather than importing  `vue-autowire/src/conventions/components` and later overridding its
`components.requireContext` and/or `components.requireAsyncContext`.
Otherwise webpack will find the `require.context` in the default convention and use it when generating the bundles, which will probably
interfere with your intended results!
:::

## Defining your own convention

Vue-Autowire is based around webpack's [`require.context`](https://webpack.js.org/api/module-methods/#requirecontext) in order to find all the files matching a certain convention, including them in the webpack bundles and register them within your Vue instance.

A convention is nothing but an object defining the different `require.context` patterns to be used for each of the different type of assets (where _asset_ is one of components, views, mixins, directives and routes).
- Every asset allows a `requireContext` property to be passed. This is assumed to be a `require.context` instance using its default mode, which adds the files to the default webpack bundle.
- In order to support async components, for components and views, there is a second property named `requireAsyncContext` that can be provided. This is expected to be a `require.context` instance using its **lazy** mode, so files loaded this way end up on their own webpack chunk!

```js
// Define the convention
const myConvention: {
  routes: {
    // All 'router.js' files
    requireContext: require.context('@/', true, /router\.js$/)
  },
  components: {
    // All '.vue' files inside the /components folder that do not end with '.local.vue' nor '.async.vue'
    requireContext: require.context('@/components', true, /\/(?:[^.]+|(?!\.local\.vue$)|(?!\.async\.vue$))\.vue$/),
    // All '.async.vue' files inside the /components folder.
    // Notice the "lazy" option, which makes webpack create a separated chunk for each of them
    requireAsyncContext: require.context('@/components', true, /async\.vue$/, 'lazy')
  },
  views: {
    requireContext: require.context(...),
    requireAsyncContext: require.context(...),
  },
  directives: {
    requireContext: require.context(...)
  },
  mixins: {
    requireContext: require.context(...)
  }
}
// Use the convention
Vue.use(VueAutowire, myConvention)
```

All the properties in the convention object are **optional**. Not providing them simply means you don't want Vue-Autowire to automatically find and register assets of that type.

For example, you might just want Vue-Autowire to find and register directives, mixins and non-async components, leaving everything else for you to manually import and register.
```js
const myConvention: {
  components: {
    // All '.vue' files inside the /components folder that do not end with '.local.vue' nor '.async.vue'
    requireContext: require.context('@/components', true, /\/(?:[^.]+|(?!\.local\.vue$)|(?!\.async\.vue$))\.vue$/),
  },
  directives: {
    // All '.js' files inside the /directives folder
    requireContext: require.context('@/directives', true, /\.js$/)
  },
  mixins: {
    // All '.js' files inside the /mixins folder
    requireContext: require.context('@/mixins', true, /\.js$/)
  }
}
Vue.use(VueAutowire, myConvention)
```

Make sure you check webpack's documentation about [`require.context`](https://webpack.js.org/api/module-methods/#requirecontext).

## Register additional elements

The convention allows up to one context per asset type that will be executed initially. If you need to register additional contexts for the same asset type, you can call registration functions directly.
```js
Vue.autowire.registerComponents(requireContext);
Vue.autowire.registerAsyncComponents(requireContext);
Vue.autowire.registerViews(requireContext);
Vue.autowire.registerAsyncViews(requireContext);
Vue.autowire.registerRoutes(requireContext);
Vue.autowire.registerFilters(requireContext);
Vue.autowire.registerDirectives(requireContext);
```
