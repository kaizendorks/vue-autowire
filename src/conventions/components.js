// Default conventions for autowiring components
// NOTES:
//  - These conventions rely on a webpack alias of "@" set to the project's root folder
//    It is done by the vue-cli by default, but devs can do so on their own projects
//  - Values here need to be primitives (not variables) since webpack will parse these when included from the end project
//    For that reason is also important to separate conventions into separated files so they can be individually imported if needed

export default {
  components: {
    // Sync components
    requireContext: require.context(
      // root folder for components
      '@/components',
      // recursive
      true,
      // include all .vue files except for the .async.vue ones
      /\/(?:[^.]+|(?!\.async\.vue$))\.vue$/
    ),
    // Async components
    requireAsyncContext: require.context(
      // root folder for components
      '@/components',
      // recursive
      true,
      // include only .async.vue components
      /async\.vue$/,
      // webpack's lazy mode for require.context
      'lazy'
    )
  }
